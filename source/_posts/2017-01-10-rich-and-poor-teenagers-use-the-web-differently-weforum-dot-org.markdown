A study from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows that "rich" teens use the web very differently from "poor" teens.

> ...richer teenagers were more likely to use the internet to search for information or to read news rather than to chat or play video games.

If you dig into the [actual report itself](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/are-there-differences-in-how-advantaged-and-disadvantaged-students-use-the-internet_5jlv8zq6hw43-en#.WHWRqmQrLMJ) you'll find a bit more context. 

> After accounting for differences in the ability to read and understand printed texts, students' socio-economic status has only a weak, and often not significant, relationship with performance in the PISA test of digital reading. In other words, students with good reading skills, regardless of their background, have a much easier time finding their way around—and mining the considerable assets of—the Internet.

Seems to echo many other reports about barriers to internet access in stating that literacy—whether digital or language—remains a significant obstacle.

The smart folks at Google are now using a technology called RAISR to shave up to 75% off the file size of the images they display. It [uses machine learning](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/11/enhance-raisr-sharp-images-with-machine.html) to enable it to be much more intelligent about the upsampling methods applied to images. Clever stuff!

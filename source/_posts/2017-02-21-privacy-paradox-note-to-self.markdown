By now I think it's become pretty clear that we haven't done a great job of educating people about the security and privacy implications of the technology they use. Much of the information around these topics tends to lean more towards fear-mongering than towards providing actionable advice and hope. 

The Privacy Paradox, a five-part series of podcasts done by [Note to Self](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself/), does an excellent job of explaining what the risks are and what can be done about it. The episodes are short and actionable: each spends some time on a privacy risk followed by a specific "challenge" you can do to take back a little control. Well worth a listen.

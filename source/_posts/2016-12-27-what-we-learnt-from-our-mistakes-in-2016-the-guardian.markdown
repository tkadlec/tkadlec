I love companies that are as invested in giving back to the community as they are at doing quality web-work. The Guardian is certainly one of them, and their latest post is a great example. They walk through several errors and mistakes they made on [their site](https://www.theguardian.com) this year, why those mistakes were made, and how they fixed them.

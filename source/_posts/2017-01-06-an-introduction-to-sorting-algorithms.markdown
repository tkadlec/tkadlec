[Harry](http://csswizardry.com/) started a [newsletter](http://csswizardry.com/newsletter/) late last year, and it's been pretty funâ€”I particularly enjoy the cocktail recipe in each issue. 

His latest issue mentions this really well-done video from TED-ed about sorting algorithms. The video uses an example of having to sort a pile of books and does a really nice job of illustrating the differences between the various algorithms at your disposal.

Back in October, I talked about the problem we have of [blaming the technique instead of the implementation](http://timkadlec.com/2012/10/blame-the-implementation-not-the-technique/). I mentioned several examples, but the one that really prompted the post was the myth of responsive design equaling bad performance.

The folks over at [24 Ways](http://24ways.org/) were kind enough to let me dig a little [deeper into the issue](http://24ways.org/2012/responsive-responsive-design/). It's sort of an extension of what I was driving at back in October (as well as what I was [whining about in January](http://timkadlec.com/2012/01/work-to-be-done/)), but with some concrete suggestions. 

To whet your appetite a bit:

> We love to tout the web’s universality when discussing the need for responsive design. But that universality is not limited simply to screen size. Networks and hardware capabilities must factor in as well.

> The web is an incredibly dynamic and interactive medium, and designing for it demands that we consider more than just visual aesthetics. Let’s not forget to give those other qualities the attention they deserve.

While you're at it, dig through the rest of the articles from this year's calendar. As always, there's loads of good stuff!

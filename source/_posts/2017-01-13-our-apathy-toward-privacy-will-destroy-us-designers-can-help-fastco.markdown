I really like the idea behind [SimplySecure](https://simplysecure.org/)â€”focusing on making security more intuitive and usable. There's a long history of usability and security being at odds and they're doing some good work to try and fix that. 

This discussion with them about how designers can improve the state of security and privacy online is well worth a read.

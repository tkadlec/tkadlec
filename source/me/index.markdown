	<p>I'm an independent web developer, consultant and trainer living in northern Wisconsin with my wife and three daughters. I’m very passionate about the Web and can frequently be found <a href="http://timkadlec.com/talks">speaking</a> about what I’ve learned at a variety of web conferences.</p>
	<p>I wrote <a href="http://implementingresponsivedesign.com">Implementing Responsive Design: Building sites for an anywhere, everywhere web</a> (New Riders, 2012) and was a contributing author for <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-4-ebooks.html">Smashing Book #4: New Perspectives on Web Design</a> (Smashing Magazine, 2013) and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Performance-Daybook-Volume-2/dp/1449332919">Web Performance Daybook Volume 2</a> (O'Reilly, 2012).

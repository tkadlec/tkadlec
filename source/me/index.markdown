<main id="what-i-do"><p>I help people and businesses make awesome things.</p>
##Strategy
The web moves forward quickly. The number of devices that people can access your site through increases by leaps and bounds each day. It can be challenging to know where to focus your efforts and how to do it. The smart companies, the ones that succeed in this environment, place strategy before technology. I can help.
##Development
Sometimes the best way to help is to roll up my sleeves and dive right in. From advising on the workflow, performing audits to help create your roadmap, ongoing code reviews, and hands-on development—I work with teams to make awesome things.
##Training
Ready to get rolling on your next project but want to give everyone a tune-up first? I provide training for teams of all sizes on performance optimization and responsive design. Whether you need a half-day, full-day, or more—I can help you make sure your team is up to date and ready to build.

	<p class="lede">“Speed is the most important feature.”—Fred Wilson, Principal of Union Square Ventures</p>
	<p>There may be no single improvement you can make to your site that will have a greater impact on your business than improving its performance.</p>
	<p>Poor performance directly impacts the way people interact with your company online—to the tune of over $3 billion lost in commerce sales in the US each year due to slow loading pages. In fact, performance has been directly tied to just about every key indicator imaginable—everything from revenue, overall traffic and bounce rate to overall brand perception and user satisfaction. With an ever-increasing global audience, the impact will only become more pronounced in the next several years.</p>

	<p>I work with companies to improve the effectiveness of their sites by ensuring that they perform quickly—regardless of the device or network in use. More importantly, I help companies develop a culture of performance within their organizations enabling them to maintain the performance of their site for the long-haul.</p>

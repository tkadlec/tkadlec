  <p>I'm an independent web developer, consultant and trainer living in northern Wisconsin with my wife and three daughters.</p>
<p>I’m very passionate about the Web and can frequently be found <a href="http://timkadlec.com/talks">speaking</a> about what I’ve learned at a variety of web conferences.</p>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://implementingresponsivedesign.com">Implementing Responsive Design: Building sites for an anywhere, everywhere web</a> (New Riders, 2012) and was a contributing author for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Web-Performance-Daybook-Volume-2/dp/1449332919">Web Performance Daybook Volume 2</a>. You can find me sharing my thoughts in a briefer format on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/tkadlec">@tkadlec</a>.</p>
<p>Formerly, I was the co-founder of <a href="http://bdconf.com">Breaking Development</a>, one of the first conferences dedicated to web design and development for mobile devices. I also hosted <a href="http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast">the Breaking Development Podcast</a>, a weekly podcast with a very similar focus (really, it was just an excuse for me to talk to people far smarter than I every week).</p>
